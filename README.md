# heroclickersautoit
An autoit script to completely automate hero clickers

I run in chrome 1920x1080 in the web browser at http://www.clickerheroes.com/ with my windows bar at the bottom, positioning
is required. 

setup: you will need to get the controlID from autoit window info in order for this to work. It's set on line 15 of the script, that way 
clicks can go directly to the control. 

It's a bit sloppy as I just coded it as I needed to, but several things are quite useful - clicking to get rubies and so on.
The script is setup to level to 1600+ and wait for a ruby, then it will ascend, then click the ruby for gold
(this is needed as I have ancient that starts me at level 300, where u need gold to hire heroes to be able to kill anything).
You can get about 100k souls per run this way. 

It will salvage any relic found during the run. 

I leave this running all night and wake up with about a million souls.

Decided to stop playing as I got all the achieves mostly through using this script, but thought I'd share it
in case anyone wanted to learn from it.
